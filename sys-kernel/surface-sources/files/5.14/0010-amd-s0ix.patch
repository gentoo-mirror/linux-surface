Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: amd-pmc: Add device HID for AMD PMC

The Surface Laptop 4 appears to have used AMD0005 for the PMC instead of
the AMDI0005 which would match the ACPI ID Registry.

AMD appears to have previously used "AMD" in a number of IDs in the past,
and AMD is not allocated to any other entity as an ID, so adding this ID
should not cause any harm.
